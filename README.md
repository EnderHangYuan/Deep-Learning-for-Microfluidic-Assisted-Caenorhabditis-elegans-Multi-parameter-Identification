Traning Steps:
1. Dataset Preparation:
In this paper, the training is conducted using the VOC format. Prior to training, it is necessary to prepare the dataset by placing the label files in the 'Annotation' folder, located within the 'VOC2007' folder, which is in turn placed under the 'VOCdevkit' folder. Similarly, the image files should be placed in the 'JPEGImages' folder, also located within the 'VOC2007' folder under the 'VOCdevkit' directory.
2. Dataset Processing:
After arranging the dataset, we need to use 'voc_annotation.py' to obtain the '2007_train.txt' and '2007_val.txt' files for training. Modify the parameters in 'voc_annotation.py'. For the initial training, you can simply modify the 'classes_path' parameter, which points to the txt file corresponding to the detection classes. When training your own dataset, you can create a 'cls_classes.txt' file and list the categories you want to distinguish. The content of the 'model_data/cls_classes.txt' file should be: cat, dog... Modify the 'classes_path' in 'voc_annotation.py' to correspond to 'cls_classes.txt' and run 'voc_annotation.py'.
3. Network Training:
There are multiple training parameters, all of which can be found in 'train.py'. After downloading the repository, it is important to carefully read the comments within the file. The most crucial part is still the 'classes_path' in 'train.py'. 'classes_path' points to the txt file corresponding to the detection classes, which should be the same as the one used in 'voc_annotation.py'! It is necessary to modify it when training your own dataset. Once the 'classes_path' is modified, you can run 'train.py' to start the training process. After training for several epochs, the weights will be generated in the 'logs' folder.
4. Prediction of Training Results:
The prediction of training results requires two files, namely 'yolo.py' and 'predict.py'. In 'yolo.py', modify the 'model_path' and 'classes_path'. 'model_path' points to the trained weight file, located in the 'logs' folder. 'classes_path' points to the txt file corresponding to the detection classes. Once the modifications are completed, you can run 'predict.py' for detection. After running, input the image path to perform detection.

Prediction Steps:

Follow the training steps to train the model. In the 'yolo.py' file, modify the 'model_path' and 'classes_path' to correspond to the trained files: The 'model_path' corresponds to the weight file under the 'logs' folder, and the 'classes_path' lists the classes associated with the 'model_path'. Perform FPS testing and video detection by running 'predict.py', inputting 'img/street.jpg', and configuring the settings within 'predict.py'.
